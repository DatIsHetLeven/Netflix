Another early influence was the groundbreaking "My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts" by Brian Eno and David Byrne.

Love is not always as we picture it in fairy tales but a work in progress for as long as we choose to love. Over the years I have written love songs and most of them have some reality in them but also a lot of fiction.
